# Hilink
I recently created a sample travel website for a fictional company named Hilink, using Next.js and Tailwind CSS to focus on developing a sleek and modern UI design. This project was a personal endeavor, not tied to any job or client work, aimed at showcasing the potential of these technologies  for building visually appealing web applications.
